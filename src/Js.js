            JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development.
             It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and
              interactive elements to websites. ... Like server-side scripting languages,
               such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML
                of a webpage
            </p>
            
            
            </div>
